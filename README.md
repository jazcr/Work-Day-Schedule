This is a simple scheduling app that allows you to input events for each hour of the typical work day. These events are saved to local storage, so they will not be lost when the page is refreshed. 

The sections for each time slot also change color depending on if the are in the past, present or future.


HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery) were used to create this app.
